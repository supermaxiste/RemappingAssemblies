# Assemblies

This folder includes one of the three assemblies used for scaffolding. The assembly available here is the _Arabidopsis lyrata_ assembly v2.1 from [Phytozome 12](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html), from which only the 8 biggest scaffolds (chromosomes) were selected. This assembly was the reference used to scaffold the other two assemblies from _A. lyrata_ and _A. halleri_.

Both the _A. lyrata_ and _A. halleri_ assemblies to be scaffolded can be found at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the accession numbers GCA_900205625.1 for _A. lyrata_ (direct link [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_900205625.1)) and GCA_900078215.1 for _A. halleri_ (direct link [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_900078215.1)). Remember to rename the assemblies according to the instructions in the main page README, or to change the appropriate scripts accordingly depending on the name you prefer.
